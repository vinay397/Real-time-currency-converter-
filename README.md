# Real-time-currency-converter-
A Java currency converter that uses a public API to get real time exchange rates and allows users to seamlessly convert between multiple currencies. The CurrencyConverter class creates a Java Swing GUI application for real-time currency conversion. At the top, it imports the required Swing packages and classes. The class extends JFrame to set up the main window and UI components including two JComboBoxes for selecting the "from" and "to" currencies, a JTextField for entering the amount to convert, a JButton to trigger the conversion, and a JLabel to display the result. The constructor initializes these components, adds them to a vertical JPanel, calls methods to populate the currency selections, and fetches the exchange rates from an API. The actionPerformed method is triggered when the user clicks the Convert button. It parses the input, calculates the conversion using the rates for the chosen currencies, and updates the result label. The manuallyAddCurrencies method hardcodes some currency options. The fetchExchangeRates method will connect to an API to get the latest rates. Finally, the main method launches the Swing GUI. Overall, this code provides a complete currency conversion application in Java Swing, demonstrating how to create the UI, connect to an external API, perform calculations, and display dynamic results to the user.
